## 207. Course Schedule

## Question

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. 
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

## Ideas

Intuition: use a map to record the pre course and the next courses. Use a BFS to traverse the course that has not prerequisites and count the number of courses. If it is equal to the numCourses, then the courses can be finished.

**How to find out the start point?**

* Use an array of indegrees. If the indegree is 0, then it can be finished.

## Highlights

**Graph Traversal**

* Each course is a vertex in a graph.
* The dependency between courses is a directed edge.
* Determine if the graph is a DAG (no cycle).

                    // Reduce the indegree.
                    indegree[next]--;
                    // If the indegree is 0, then add it to the queue.
